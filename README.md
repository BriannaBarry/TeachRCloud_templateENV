# Starting R

This is an RStudio.cloud project set up by StatPrep Annie to provide templates for other StatPREP instructors using R for their own courses. 

Many R packages are pre-installed in this project. These include:

- tidyverse
- mosaic (which automatically installs mosaicData, mosaicCore, and ggformula)
- mosaicModel
- learnr (which includes shiny, etc)
- knitr
